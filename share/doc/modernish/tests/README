This directory contains scripts that test modernish functionality in ways
that make them unsuitable for the regression test suite ('modernish --test');
either they cause a heavy system load, or they are intended to die() which
reliably terminates the entire program.

Some of these also serve as interesting code examples of modernish scripts,
along with the scripts in examples/.

--- die-bg-test.sh ---
# This test program demonstrates that 'die' can kill the main program
# even from a background subshell.

--- harden-test.sh ---
# This tests command hardening (sys/cmd/harden module).
# See README.md under "Modules" -> "use sys/cmd/harden" for more info.

--- local-test.sh ---
# This tests LOCAL blocks: local variables and shell options within
# arbitrary code blocks (var/local module).
# See README.md under "Modules" -> "use var/local" for more info.

--- mktemp-stresstest.sh ---
# Stress test for atomicity of modernish' "mktemp" implementation.
# Try to create many temp files in parallel (default 400).
# See README.md under "Modules" -> "use sys/base/mktemp" for more info.
#
# This script deliberately uses weird characters (spaces, tabs, newlines)
# in the directory and file names to test for robustness on that, too.

--- shellquote-test.sh ---
# Test and demonstration program for shellquote().
# See README.md under "Low-level shell utilities" -> "shellquote" for more info.
#
# This program includes an -N option for trying the current shell's builtin
# quoting algorithm. Its output is not always portable, and it's generally
# *much* worse at minimising exponential growth when quoting multiple times.
