Usage: modernish [ OPTIONS ] [ ARGUMENT ...]
By default, the first argument is the name of a modernish script to run, and
the second and subsequent arguments become that script's positional parameters.
Options are any short- and long-form shell options supported by the shell that
is running modernish, plus the following:
  --help
	Show this help.
  --test [ OPTIONS ]
	Run the modernish regression test suite. Use --test -h for help.
  --use=MODULE
	Pre-load a modernish module before executing the given script.
  --version
	Show the version of modernish.
  -c	Take the first argument as the script code to run instead of loading it
	from a file. If given, the second argument becomes the program name or
	path ($ME) and the third and subsequent arguments become the script's
	positional parameters.
  -n	Check syntax of a portable-form modernish script without executing it.
  -s	Read the script from standard input. Any arguments become the script's
	positional parameters.
