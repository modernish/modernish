# This test program demonstrates that 'die' can kill the main program
# even from a background subshell.
#
# Conversely, the trap on INT (user presses Ctrl-C) demonstrates how to kill
# the background job from the main shell (which was always possible).

# Demonstrate that modernish has a DIE pseudosignal; its traps will be
# executed when 'die' is called. The pseudosignal cannot be ignored.

# 'trap', so no 'exit' needed)
