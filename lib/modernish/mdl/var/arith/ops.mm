# modernish var/arith/ops
#
# --- Integer arithmetic operator shortcuts. ---
# Usage: inc/dec/mult/div/ndiv/mod <varname> [ <expr> ]
# Increase/decrease/multiply/divide/modulus the value of the variable by the
# result of the integer arithmetic expression <expr>. Default for <expr> is
# 1 for 'inc' and 'dec', 2 for 'mult' and 'div', 256 for 'mod'.
#
# ndiv: always round down, even for negative numbers.
# Usage: ndiv <varname> [ <expr> ]
# ndiv is like div, but always returns the integer on or before
# $((varname / expr)), even for negative numbers. Standard shell
# arith just chops off the digits after the decimal point, which
# is not ok for negative. (The idea is from wide_strftime.sh by
# St√©phane Chazelas: http://stchaz.free.fr)
