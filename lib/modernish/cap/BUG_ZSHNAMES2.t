# BUG_ZSHNAMES2: Two lowercase variable names 'histchars' and 'signals',
# normally okay for script use as per POSIX convention, are reserved for
# special use on zsh, even if zsh is initialised in sh mode (via a 'sh'
# symlink or using the '--emulate sh' option at startup).
#
# Bug found on: zsh <= 5.7.1.
# See also BUG_ZSHNAMES.
