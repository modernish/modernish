# WRN_MULTIBYTE: We're running on a locale with a variable-length character
# set (i.e. UTF-8) but the shell does not support multi-byte characters. For
# instance, ${#var} measures length in bytes, not characters.
# Note: Currently, WRN_MULTIBYTE is only detected if we're in a UTF-8 locale.
# (This is the only multibyte locale supported by current shells.)
# It should not be detected for single-byte locales as it's irrelevant there.
