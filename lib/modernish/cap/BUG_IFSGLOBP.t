# BUG_IFSGLOBP: in pathname expansion (filename globbing), if a
# wildcard character is part of IFS, it is matched literally instead of as a
# matching character. This applies to glob characters '*', '?' and '['.
# Bug found in bash (all versions up to at least 4.4).
# Ref: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2016-11/msg00013.html

# Save IFS (note: _Msh_test is guaranteed unset at start)
isset IFS && _Msh_test=$IFS

# Turn on globbing temporarily if it's off (set -f)
case $- in
( *f* )	set +f
